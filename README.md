 This repository is a personal learning journal and workspace as I attempt to learn python for financial analysis and algorithmic trading. 

The aim is to develop strong foundations in **quantitative finance**, **algorithmic trading**, and **Python programming for trading systems**, before then applying these lessons to my own financial markets projects â€” looking at **commodities** and **foreign exchange**, for example.
